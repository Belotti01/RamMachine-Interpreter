# WIP
TODO:
- Better UI for the code, inputs and output areas
- Manage infinite loops (fix "Interrupt" button not showing while the interpreter is executing)
- Step-by-step execution
- Numbered code lines for better error reporting
- Review interpreter class to be more scalable
- Add code examples page
- Add relevant external links

Will probably start using MudBlazor for the UI at some point to avoid reinventing the wheel (and making it squared in the process)
